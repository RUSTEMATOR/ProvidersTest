  - text: King Billy Casino - An online casino to rule them all! 
  - paragraph: Dear guest, welcome to the land of King Billy, known by many names all around the world. Some like to call it the land of online casino games. We call it the land of joy, the land where online casino slots, table games, poker games and jackpots thrive, the land where the worries are little and the bonuses are big!
  - paragraph: What lies outside our land? Well, it’s a jungle out there. When you decide to search for an online casino in your favorite engine, the possibilities are that you will come up with more results than the number of Mark Zuckerberg’s friends (well, almost). Online casino? In the hundreds! Online casino free to play? In the thousands! Online casino slots? In the hundreds of thousands! So, where to start from?
  - paragraph: The fact that you are, now, reading these lines is encouraging! Your search to find an online casino to win real money is on the right track with King Billy Casino. However, you know something folks? We want you to leave. Yes, you read it right! We want you to leave the Kingdom of King Billy and wander around on the vast jungle, known as the World Wide Web and check online casino slots beyond the King Billy borders!
  - text: The world of online casino slots 
  - paragraph: There are some games all players worth their salt recognize, unless they‘ve been in a coma for the last quarter of a century. Online casino games which make the sky Starburst, or take your breath away with Vikings’ adventures or make you smile when this pudgy explorer called Gonzo brings stones tumbling down, just to name a few classics.
  - paragraph: But appearances can be deceiving. It is true that when slots like the above come from an online casino with no deposit bonuses or an online casino with no deposit at all, His Majesty, King Billy, First of His Line, Rightful Ruler of the Kingdom, Guardian of the Realm, Supreme Commander of the Royal Forces and Protector of the Players gives a royal thumb up.
  - paragraph: But this is not always the case. An online casino should be more than a logo and a flashy menu which boasts online casino games, live casino or online casino slots. For starters, what is its reputation level? In today’s world, where reputation matters even when buying chewing gum from street kiosks, wouldn’t you want to know that when you go to an online casino to win real money, you go to a site tested and approved by the community?
  - paragraph: "But appearances can be deceiving. It is true that when slots like the above come from an online casinoAnd this is exactly the case with King Billy Casino. We asked you to leave our site and search for any type of online casino. But if you did a peer-reviewed search or just asked for the opinion of seasoned fellow players, you would get the same answer: King Billy is an online casino free of stress, an online casino free of worries, but full of the best slots and providers on the market and more!"
  - text: Live Casino and more! 
  - paragraph: Life would be rather boring, if an online casino was an one-trick pony. Although there are cases where operators specialize in certain areas, being an online casino with no deposit (only), or an online casino with no deposit bonuses and very little in pretty much everything else, would be rather dull and a waste of your time.
  - paragraph: This is why the King has ordered his Servants to pack everything you need in order to play online casino slots and many more, all in one place! Let’s start from the bonuses, where our King thinks BIG and offers you 4 huge bonuses for your first 4 deposits!
  - paragraph: Furthermore, if you are looking for an online casino to win real money, you needn’t look any further than King Billy! We have Extra Weekend, the King’s Gift, Spin & Win, the King’s Miners and the King’s Tournaments waiting for you. Just visit our promotion pages!
  - paragraph: Let’s move on to the heart of any gaming business, the games, where King Billy features more than 5.000 of them, bringing you the latest and coolest online casino games (including online casino slots and live casino games) from “Absolute Super Reels” to “Zany Zebra” – truly A to Z!
  - paragraph: Let’s сontinue with speed of payment never seen before and all the transaction methods you may need plus 5 cryptocurrency modes (Bitcoin, BitcoinCash, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dogecoin) to play all your favorite online casino games without the slightest interruption!
  - paragraph: So, why should you wait? This is an online casino with no deposit bonuses which will make your jaw drop. An online casino free of worries but full of fun where you can become a Citizen today and become a Baron or Baroness, Duke or Duchess, Prince or Princess and finally King or Queen. This is YOUR online casino. Play long and prosper folks!
